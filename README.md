# WSL Assistant 🚀  
*Run a fully integrated AI and database stack on your low-end, CPU-only Windows machine—secure, resilient, and privacy-focused.*  

WSL Assistant brings **on-device AI** to **low-power systems** by leveraging WSL2 and Debian. Unlike traditional AI setups that require **power-hungry GPUs**, this project is built **for CPUs only**—allowing you to run **efficient local inference** and a **full RAG pipeline** on even modest hardware.  

With WSL Assistant, you can **self-host AI assistants, chatbots, and knowledge graphs** without relying on external cloud APIs. The lightweight stack includes:  
✅ **llama.cpp** for blazing-fast **CPU inference**  
✅ **Redis Stack** for vector database storage  
✅ **Neo4j** for knowledge graphs  
✅ **Optimized for low-end Windows laptops & edge devices**  

With a memory footprint as low as **1GB**, WSL Assistant lets you run **local AI inference and an entire RAG pipeline on a 10-year-old device!**

## **2. Overview**  

### **2.1 Why This Project Exists?**  
Most AI frameworks are built for **high-end GPUs**, making them **unusable on older machines** or **low-power edge devices**. WSL Assistant solves this by providing:  
- **A fully integrated CPU-based AI environment** for local inference.  
- **A lightweight stack (only ~1GB RAM)** to run AI models without lag.  
- **An optimized RAG pipeline** with Redis + Neo4j for AI-powered retrieval.  
- **No cloud dependency**—your data stays **local and private**.  

### **2.2 Why WSL and Debian?**  
- **WSL2**: Runs Linux on Windows with near-native performance.  
- **Debian**: Stable, secure, and lightweight—ideal for low-resource machines.  
- **No need for Docker**: Avoids container overhead while still maintaining isolation.  

### **2.3 What Are the Components and Their Purpose?**  
| Component      | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| **Redis Stack**  | Fast vector database for AI embeddings |
| **Neo4j**       | Graph database for knowledge management |
| **llama.cpp**   | Local AI inference engine (CPU-optimized) |
| **Fail2Ban & UFW** | Security hardening against brute-force attacks |
| **Systemd Auto-Restart** | Ensures services are resilient to crashes |

---

## **3. Use Cases**  
- **AI-powered local search**: Store and retrieve knowledge with Redis + Neo4j.  
- **Self-hosted AI assistant**: Use `llama.cpp` for **CPU-only inference**.  
- **Privacy-first chatbots**: Avoid OpenAI/Google APIs—run everything **offline**.  
- **Edge AI applications**: Ideal for **low-end devices** with limited compute.  

---

## **4. Features**  

### **4.1 Security** 🔒  
✅ **Disables root SSH login**  
✅ **Enables firewall (ufw) and Fail2Ban** to prevent attacks  
✅ **Automatic security updates**  

### **4.2 Resiliency** 🔄  
✅ **Auto-restarts essential services** after crashes  
✅ **Persistent Redis storage** for AI embeddings  
✅ **WSL2 optimizations for memory efficiency**  

### **4.3 Privacy** 🛡️  
✅ No external cloud dependencies  
✅ Local **AI inference with llama.cpp**  
✅ **Fully air-gapped if needed**  

### **4.4 CPU-Optimized AI-Powered RAG Pipeline** 🤖  
1️⃣ **User query →** Sent to `llama.cpp` (CPU-only)  
2️⃣ **Query transformed →** Passed to Redis vector DB  
3️⃣ **Relevant knowledge retrieved →** From Neo4j knowledge graph

## **10. Common Issues & Fixes**  

❓ **Q: Redis Stack Server is not starting**  
✅ **Fix**: Run `sudo systemctl restart redis-stack-server`  

❓ **Q: "Out of memory" error when loading models**  
✅ **Fix**:  
- Try a smaller GGUF model (`SmolLM2-360M-Instruct.q8.gguf`)  
- Increase **WSL2 memory**: Edit `.wslconfig` and set:  
  ```ini
  [wsl2]
  memory=8GB
  ```
